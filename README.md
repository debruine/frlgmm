#Face Research Lab Geometric Morphometric Functions

Convenience functions supporting the visualisation of stimuli delineated in Psychomorph, using Face Research Lab (facelab.org) defaults.

##Notes

1. On a Mac, you'll probably need to install X11 from http://xquartz.macosforge.org and have this running anytime you want to run geomorph
2. The package comes with a text dataset called `faces`
