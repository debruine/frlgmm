# Face Research Lab Geometric Morphometric Functions

Convenience functions supporting the visualisation of stimuli delineated in [WebMorph](http://webmorph.org) or Psychomorph, using [Face Research Lab](http://facelab.org) defaults.

## Notes

1. On a Mac, you'll need to install X11 from http://xquartz.macosforge.org before you install the `geomorph` package
2. The package comes with a text dataset called `faces`
